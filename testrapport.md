# Testspecifikation
Modulen har endast testats med automatiska tester. Testningen har utförts med Jest v29.7.0. För att kunna köra testerna har följande sträng angivits inuti ```scripts``` i package.json:
```
"test": "npx --node-options=--experimental-vm-modules jest --setupFiles"
```
För att starta testerna används således kommandot ```npm test```.  

Testerna består av en testsvit med totalt 94 deltester som är uppdelade enligt de 17 publika metoder som anropas av testerna, se nedan. Samtliga tester är godkända i v.1.0.0 av modulen.

I mappen 'testdata' finns två filer, exampleCode.js och loremIpsum.md. Innehållet i dessa filer används som argument vid skapandet av två olika instanser av modulen som används under testningen.

Bland de deltester som testar metoden ```getLetterCountDifferenceBetweenOriginalAndUpdatedText()``` måste deltestet som heter *'should return the difference between the original and updated text when using text from loremIpsum file as input'* köras före deltestet som heter *'should return a string that says "No words have been replaced." when changing the words back to the original text string'*.
